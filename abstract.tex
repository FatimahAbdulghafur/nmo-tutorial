Open any text book about seismic data processing and you will inevitably find a
section about the Normal Moveout (NMO) correction.
There you'll see that we can correct the measured travel-time of a reflected
wave ($t$) at a given offset ($x$) to obtain the travel-time at normal
incidence ($t_0$) by applying the following equation 
(or some variation of this equation that relates $t_0$, $t$, and $x$ with varying degrees of accuracy)

\begin{equation}
t_0^2=t^2-\dfrac{x^2}{v_{NMO}^2}
\label{eq:traveltime}
\end{equation}

in which $v_{NMO}$ is the NMO velocity.

When applied to a Common Mid Point (CMP) section, the equation above is
supposed to turn the hyperbola associated with a reflection into a straight
horizontal line.
What most text books won't tell you is \textit{how, exactly, do you apply this
equation to the data}?

Read on and I'll explain step-by-step how the algorithm for NMO correction from
\citet{Yilmaz_2001} works and how to implement it in Python.
The accompanying Jupyter notebook \citep{Perez_2007} contains the full source
code, with documentation and tests for each function.
