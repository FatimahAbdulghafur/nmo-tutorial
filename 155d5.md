# What the equation doesn't tell us

How the basic equation for NMO. Pretty simple right?
Here is a CMP gather. How do you plug it into the equation?
The CMP is like a matrix of amplitude values.
And I want to transform that into another matrix of amplitudes correct for NMO.
But there is no amplitude in the equation!
What now?


Figure: A CMP (a) next to an NMO (b). Axis show that time in (b) is t0. Arrow connecting a cell in (a) to a cell in (b). Arrow should go both ways and show respective time conversion equations. Probably better to use travel time curves instead of real data for this.
