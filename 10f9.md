# Doing it backwards

How do  we find where each point in the CMP should go in the final NMO corrected gather?
It’s surprisingly difficult to find a description of the actual method of calculating amplitudes in NMO correction.
The only one I found is a paragraph from Yilmaz (http://wiki.seg.org/wiki/NMO_for_a_flat_reflector):


> “The idea is to find the amplitude value at A′ on the NMO-corrected gather from the
