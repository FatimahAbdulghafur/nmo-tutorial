# Putting my code where my mouth is

Describe the algorithm relating it to the source code.
Define the algorithm in functions, going from general to specific:


    def nmo_correction(cmp, dt, offsets, velocities):

    def reflection_time(t0, offset, velocity):

    def sample_trace(trace, time, dt):


Figure: (a) CMP, (b) velocity profile, (c) NMO. Maybe include lines in the NMO with the true two-way travel time.
