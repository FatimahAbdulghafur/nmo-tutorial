\section{What the equation doesn't tell us}

The equation for $t_0$ relates travel-times: the one we can measure ($t$)
and the one we want to know ($t_0$).
But the data in our CMP gather are actually a matrix of \textit{amplitudes}
measured as a function of time ($t$) and offset.
Our NMO corrected gather will also be a matrix of amplitudes as a function of
time ($t_0$) and offset.
So what we really have to do transform one matrix of amplitudes into the other.
\textit{But the equation has no amplitudes}!

This is a major divide between the formula we've all seen before and what
actually goes on in the software that implements it.
And most of you probably never thought about it (I certainly hadn't).
So let us bridge this divide.
Next, I'll explain an algorithm that maps the amplitudes in the CMP to
amplitudes in an NMO corrected gather.
