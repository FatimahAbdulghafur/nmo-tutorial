Figure 1: Sketch of the algorithm for a single trace and \(t_0\). On the left is a trace from the CMP and on the right the corresponding trace from the NMO corrected gather. The green square in the NMO is the amplitude  at \(t_0\) that we want to calculate. We apply the equation to find time \(t\) in the CMP, then interpolate the amplitude using the four samples around \(t\) (orange rectangles). This amplitude is then copied over to the NMO.
