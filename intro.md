# What the equation doesn't tell us

The equation for \(t_0\) relates travel-times: the one we can measure (\(t\)) and the one we want to know (\(t_0\)).
But looking at figure 1a, we can see that the data in our CMP gather are actually a matrix of *amplitudes* measured as a function of time (\(t\)) and offset.
Our NMO corrected gather will also be a matrix of amplitudes as a function of time (\(t_0\)) and offset.
So what we really have to do is figure out how to transform one matrix of amplitudes into the other.
*But the equation has no amplitudes*!


Here is a CMP gather. How do you plug it into the equation?
The CMP is like a matrix of amplitude values.
And I want to transform that into another matrix of amplitudes correct for NMO.
But there is no amplitude in the equation!
What now?


Figure: A CMP (a) next to an NMO (b). Axis show that time in (b) is t0. Arrow connecting a cell in (a) to a cell in (b). Arrow should go both ways and show respective time conversion equations. Probably better to use travel time curves instead of real data for this.
