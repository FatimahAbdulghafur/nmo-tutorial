Open any text book about seismic data processing and you will inevitably find a section about the Normal Moveout (NMO) correction. 
There you'll see that we can correct the measured travel-time of a reflected wave (\(t\)) at a given offset (\(x\)) to obtain the travel-time at normal incidence (\(t_0\)) by applying the following equation (or something derived from it)



The accompanying Jupyter notebook contains the full source code as well as an interactive example for velocity analysis.
You can download the notebook at [github.com/seg](https://github.com/seg) or find links to run it online at [github.com/pinga-lab/nmo-tutorial](https://github.com/pinga-lab/nmo-tutorial).
